## 🚀 Playground

Welcome to my collection of side projects! This repository is a hub for various experiments, tools, and ideas I've worked on over time. Each project lives in its own subdirectory and has its own purpose, dependencies, and documentation.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each subdirectory in this repo represents a separate project. You can find more details about each one—including setup instructions, usage, and goals by checking out the `README.md` file within that project's folder.

## 🔧 Requirements

Most projects are independent and will specify their own requirements. Some may require:

- Git
- Docker
- Python, Go, Java, etc. (varies by project)
- Any other relevant tools or libraries

Check each subdirectory's README for exact prerequisites and instructions.

## 📝 Notes

- These projects range from tiny utilities to full-blown prototypes.
- Some are polished, others are rough sketches.
- Feedback, ideas, and contributions are always welcome!
